This GitHub repository serves as documentation for setting up a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) to emulate the functions of a Windows server within a production environment. The VM acts as a secure and dedicated repository for the company's database, replicating an on-premise system.

## Project Milestones
### 1. Virtual Machine Setup
Set up a Windows Virtual Machine as the cornerstone of the production environment.
Configure network settings and firewall rules for secure operations.
Establish connection to the VM using the RDP protocol for efficient management.
### 2. Database Setup
Install SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on the VM.
Initiate a remote connection to the VM using Microsoft Remote Desktop and RDP protocol.
Create a production database by restoring the AdventureWorks database from the provided backup file.
